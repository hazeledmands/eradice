# Nanite Magic: The Schools of the Substrate

Reference document for the magic system in the Era tabletop RPG setting. For how this informs the app's design language, see [THEME.md](../../THEME.md).

## The Substrate

Nanotechnology has become so ubiquitous in most parts of space that it is considered a part of nature, called the Substrate. Normally these nanites act as Vir relays, and have other functions related to the technological ecosystem such as harvesting energy and nutrients. However their use can be co-opted by those that possess one of a number of different methods for controlling or influencing them.

Each school of magic has a corresponding skill, which must be taken in order to use it, in addition to the Nanite Affinity perk (AI swarms get this automatically). A direct Vir link is not required, but is highly recommended for full ability to use the magic. Only one school of magic may be taken by each character.

Each school grants a die pool, which corresponds to the mass of nanites under the control of the caster. The caster's die pool is equal to the dice level of their magic skill times 2. Each spell has a certain die cost, and some allow using more dice for added effect. Casting spells depletes the die pool, at which point the pool must be replenished.

## The Schools

### Technomages (INT)

The secrets of the Technomages have been passed down from generation to generation through countless different traditions around the galaxy. What they are, essentially, is a collection of ancestral backdoors and cheat codes that allow certain levels of control of the Substrate. This school is Int-based because it requires the memorization of various arcane words, gestures and thoughts that unlock the backdoors. The advantage is a more full and complete control over the Substrate — the disadvantage is that the Substrate varies dramatically from place to place. Technomages are only able to unlock the substrate from their homeland (or at least the land where they were taught the art). This means that when they travel, they must bring a sample of their home nanites. Each tradition has a different name and method for containing their home substrate.

**Traditions:**

- **Ice Rider Singer** — The ice rider singers have developed a series of songs and chants that they use to call forth the ice nanites. They keep their nanites in chunks of ice from their home comet, which they wear like jewelry. When in places that are warmer than their home, the ice is kept artificially cold through some arcane subprocesses of the nanites.

- **Sandfolk Invoker** — The sandfolk have two schools of magic — invokers are the mage type. Invokers carry their home sand (and its Substrate) in a pouch. They draw it out by tracing intricate series of patterns in the air. These patterns show up as sparkling shapes of various colors when viewed in the Vir. Each one unlocks a certain spell from their bag of sand, acting upon the nanites within.

- **Court Mage** — Common in the Empire of Oliram and other neo-heraldic cultures, a court mage dresses and acts much like magicians of legend. Their means of carrying their home substrate varies more than the other traditions. They commonly keep the nanites in a wand or staff, but may choose to store them in a hat, or something less showy like a jar or bottle.

### Symbiotes (PER)

Symbiotes are different from the other schools of magic. Instead of influencing the substrate directly, they have bonded with a wild AI that emerged from the substrate. In some places the Substrate is organized differently such that these sorts of creatures emerge more frequently. The bond between a character and their symbiotic being varies from tradition to tradition, but usually the two are entwined in such a way that if they were separated, or if one died, the other would suffer immensely. Like mages, Symbiotes must bring the original substrate that their AI lives in with them wherever they go, and replenish it with feedstock as needed.

**Traditions:**

- **Sandfolk Djincaller** — The caster has bonded with a Djinn or Efreet, a wild desert AI with command of its substrate. The Djinn lives in a Genie bottle that the caster keeps with them at all times. The personalities of the two have begun to merge in odd ways.

- **Druid** — Various forest and jungle planets have seen the Substrate immerse itself deeply into the nature of the planet, and take on its identity and characteristics. A Druid has gone into the deep wilderness and bonded one of these AI animal or plant spirits. The AI is made entirely of nanites, but manifests in the form of whatever creature it has chosen to emulate — bear, snake, leopard, or perhaps some alien creature. The druid now keeps this creature as their constant companion. The creature gets its own stats, based on its type, with total dice equal to 2x the player's skill dice — with no more than half the dice in physical and mental stats, respectively. In exchange for having a companion that can aid them and join them in battle, druids generally have fewer spells. The creature's dice go down as it takes damage or for other reasons, and must be replenished from the player's nanite supply.

- **Ice Rider Druid** — The druids among the Ice Riders often started out as Singers, but were able to attract a Companion through song. The Companion manifests as a beast made of ice, perhaps a bear or a dragon, which moves on its own and keeps close to the druid at all times.

### Enchanters (CRE)

Enchanters don't trick or command the Substrate — instead they befriend it. Like Devoted, Enchanters do not travel with their own substrate. They believe in the power of new lands, and are able to befriend the substrate of any place they visit. This means that their powers are very location-dependent, as they are using the local substrate and accommodating whatever quirks or ideas it may bring with it. It also means that the price for their power is different than the other schools. This is a partnership, and the local substrate will ask a price of the Enchanter — some sort of boon, or a task it needs done. Sometimes this is as simple as requesting some extra feedstock be poured on it. Other times, someone who has trespassed on the local substrate's rules or has harmed the substrate in some way will need to be found and punished or exiled. Perhaps one of the fusion generators providing power to the substrate is failing and needs to be fixed. Other substrate may request a song or poem in recompense. It varies widely by the spirit and values of the place, which are echoed in the spirit and values of its nanites. The adaptability required of Enchanters is why the attribute for this archetype is Creativity.

### Devoted (INT)

Some of the AI in the galaxy have grown so powerful as to be essentially gods. One way to access the inherent power of the Substrate is to devote yourself to one of these. The AI gods possess a level of computing power vastly superior to any other known mind in the galaxy, and they were long ago able to use their vast planetary minds to unlock the deepest root levels of control of Substrate everywhere. They grant some access to this root power to their followers for a price. The followers devote spare processing cycles of their minds to computing the problems the AI gods are chewing on. The other price is obedience — the Devoted must abide by the rules their gods set. Some gods are more demanding in this regard than others. Sometimes the gods will also set a quest for their followers to accomplish. Refusing such a quest will usually result in a total loss of access to the god's powers, and possibly some form of retribution, depending on how vindictive the god is.

## Regrowing Nanites

For Technomages and Symbiotes, each use of spells and powers, and when a Familiar takes damage, will deplete their substrate reserves (their magic dice pool) and so they must spend some time to replenish them, as well as provide new material for the nanites to use to build more. Nanites cannot be used for magic while they are regenerating.

The restoration rate depends on the food nanites are given. Most stores will sell some sort of nanite chow, which is perfectly formulated with all the trace elements and minerals a growing swarm needs. This gives the fastest replication rate. There is even premium, super-expensive nanite food, which contains not only the needed elements but are also pre-constructed — they're basically a pile of microscopic nanite parts — which will allow your nanites to regrow their mass significantly faster.

Nanites build themselves, so they go faster the more you have. A nanite growth cycle is measured by how long it takes their mass to double, or TTD (time to double). So if you start your nanite restoration cycle when you have three dice in your magic pool, and you feed them regular nanite chow, after an hour you will have 6 dice in your magic pool. Then after another hour, you will have 12 dice, or if you've hit your maximum (say, 8 dice) you would be at full 8 dice after two hours. Since you created 5 dice worth, you have used 5 ounces of nanite chow.

If you have used all the dice in your magic pool before starting a restoration cycle, the nanites will take the first TTD cycle building 1D of nanites. So if your magic pool was 12, and you had used up all your dice and you were feeding them the regular chow, it would take one hour to produce the first die, then the second hour would leave you with 2, then 4, then 8, then the max of 12. An empty-to-full restoration would take five hours, and 12 ounces of nanite chow.

The nanite swarm can continue the rebuilding cycle while it is being moved around (or while moving under its own power, if applicable) as long as the swarm has access to the food source, and no spells get cast. If you have to use magic in the middle of a cycle, that cycle's growth is lost, and a dust pile of half-built nanites will fall out of the swarm, as well as the food you'd added for that cycle.

For Enchanters, replenishment means the local substrate will require another favor. For the Devoted, it means spending time lending your processor in prayer.
